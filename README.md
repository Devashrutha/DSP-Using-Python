# DSP Using Python
Harmonic voice enhancer enables the user to select the harmonic frequencies and amplify it for greater amplitude output while suppressing the noise frequencies. This voice enhancer is not real time and requires an audio wav file sampled at 44.1kHz for amplification.

Vowel detector is a basic bare bones program that detects if the vowel is either 'u' or 'o' based on their formant frequencies. This is also not done in real time and is just an example of how to go about detecting individual vowels from individual vowel audio files.
